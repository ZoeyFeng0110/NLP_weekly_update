Open Ext. Rick's Ship in flying through a planet's rings
(Morty is in the backseat, Summer is in the starboard seat, Rick is driving)
All: (singing) Love. Connection. Experience.
(Morty claps)
Rick: Yeah Morty
All: (singing) Come together. With love. connection, experience! [laughter]
Rick: It's my favourite song.
Morty: Hahahahaha, yeah.
(distress beacon alert chimes)
Rick: Oh yeah, distress beacon! [belches] Yeah baby!
Morty: You're excited about that?
Rick: The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!
[Rick makes a sharp turn]
